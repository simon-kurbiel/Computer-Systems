## Different Numbering System
---
1. Decimal. What most of humans use. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
2. Binary.  What computers use. 0,1
3. Hex      This is base 16. {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,A,B,C,D,E,F}

## Boolean Algebra
1. The & and bitwise operator : if 1 & 1, It will be set to 1, Otherwise it will be 0.
2. The |  or bitwise operator : will only be set two 0 when you do 0 | 0
3. The ^ xor bitwise operator : will be set to 1 if they are different, otherwise it will be 0

## Integer Representations

### 1. Unsigned Numbers :
1. The Maximum number that you can have is $2^n$-1 where n is the number of bits
2. On the other hand, the least amount of numbers that you can store is 0
#### For example,
char only has 8bits which is 1 byte. in this case, the maximum number is $2^8$ - 1 which is 255

### signed Numbers:
1. In the case of signed numbers the least significant bit has negative weight. 1000(binary) = -1 * $2^3$ = -8
